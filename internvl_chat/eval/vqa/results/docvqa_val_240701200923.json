Massive clean-ups of Smok1 (DM) were done with searches for old/obsolete coding and inconsistencies, in preparation for switching to SYBASE. Found almost 10000 panelsists with 2ids also, thanks to Paul Lipsford restoring old Dec files——1982, 1983, & 1984. This is what Nick Codyles was supposed to have done in 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, & 1984. April 17-18: Smok1 was loaded into SYBASE, as Smok. Robin Llipsford made the database and provided preparatory programming. I made final modifications to my programs that use data extracted from the database——nothing is ever exactly as you thought it was supposed to be. So far (on the basis of four days) performance is impressive and I am more than pleased to be transferred to SYBASE. The data loading part is not as quick as the way it was handled on the IDM, but I can accommodate to that because of the build-in verifications it does. Still, it would be nicer to optimize this part also.

The inclusion of a cavity and prefilter has been shown to reduce harshness and improve taste. Smoke pH of the cigarettes was reduced considerably. Several filter materials have been tested as prefilters. Their impact on T/N ratio and volatile nicotine are currently being evaluated by an informal panel.

Defining the bony landmarks of the ischium and pubis during exposure greatly facilitates proper acetabular component position. The plane created by the pubis and the ischium can serve as a guide for proper acetabular shell orientation. The cup should be slightly more antiverted than the pubis/ischial plate. This relation-ship between the pubis/ischial plate and the cup should remain constant regardless of the depth of the shell trial. Even liners trials should be slightly more 53 mm shell trials. Using shell and liner trials in conjunction with the femoral component trials aids in ensuring optimum position of the components.
